This is a single page Rails web app that interacts with Google's Geocoder API. Input any address and it returns the longitude, latitude, and fully, properly formatted version of your address. All queries are listed beneath the input form.

To run this application, first:
* Generate a Google Geocoder's API Developer Key at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro
* Add this line into your config/secrets.yml file:
    common: &common
      geocode_api_key: GEOCODE_API_KEY
